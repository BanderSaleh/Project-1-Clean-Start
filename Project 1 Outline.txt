Project Process:

1. Created a new SQL project (containing a view to display specific Employee data from AdventureWorksDW2019.bak database) and then I created a new C# XAML project (with a MainWindow incorporating a WPF DataGrid object (and Button?)



2. Learned about "LINQ"

Read this Introduction To LINQ url: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/introduction-to-linq/

Learned that I need the "LINQ to SQL" provider to fetch data from a SQL database. "LINQ to SQL" supports SQL: transactions, views, and stored procedures. To Update the SQL Database when the C# project gets updated, we use "LINQ to XML" provider.




3. Installed "LINQ to SQL" and "ASP.NET Web Application" via Visual Studios Installer and clicked Modify as instructed in this link that I found searching google: how to install LINQ to SQL:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/data-tools/linq-to-sql-tools-in-visual-studio2?view=vs-2022

EDIT: (Step 5 technically I hit a roadblock and did this to fix):
Link I followed when I needed to install ASP.NET Web Application: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-aspnet-45-web-forms/create-the-project



4. Added a New Item to my C# project name in the solution explorer called Sample.dbml. Inside that new file: I had to connect to my SQL Database AdventureWorksDW2019 just like what I do on SQL. Then, I dragged the tables needed to run my SQL code that Joins multiple tables.

used this tutorial link: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-use-linq-to-sql-for-retrieving-data-from-sql-server-database/



5. Cleanly called the 3 SQL Tables to my MainWindow.xaml.cs and then created requested ViewModel class

10. Created a GitHub Repo containing 2 folders: SQL project folder & C# project folder

I simply dragged the main parent folder (containing both projects) to GitHub Desktop



5. 


Bonus Step: Add Bootstrap elements
